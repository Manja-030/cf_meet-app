### FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY

#### *As a user I should be able to “filter events by city” so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.*

GIVEN the main page is open  
WHEN user starts typing in the city textbox  
THEN the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

**Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.**  
GIVEN the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox  
And the list of suggested cities is showing
WHEN the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list  
THEN their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”) and the list of suggestions should disappear and the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

### FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS

GIVEN the app is open  
WHEN the user has not entered a number in the “number of events” field  
THEN the user will see the default number 32
